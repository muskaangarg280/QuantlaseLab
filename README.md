# QuantlaseLab

This project demonstrates the application of **Echo State Networks (ESNs)** for **time series forecasting**, particularly focused on **stock price prediction** using historical data from the S&P 500 index.

## Overview

During my internship, I explored the practical deployment of machine learning algorithms by working on:
- Restructuring unorganized ML scripts into clean, **modular, class-based architectures**.
- Understanding the end-to-end machine learning pipeline: from **data preprocessing** to **model training**, **evaluation**, and **real-world prediction**.
- Implementing a **reservoir computing model** (ESN) for sequence prediction tasks.

## Project Goals

- Predict closing prices of stock market data using ESNs.
- Evaluate prediction performance using RMSE and visualizations.
- Restructure legacy ML scripts for better clarity and extensibility.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- NumPy, Pandas for data processing
- Matplotlib for plotting
- Custom esn.py for ESN model
- scikit-learn for evaluation metrics (RMSE, etc.)

## Project Outcomes

- Achieved reasonable predictive performance using a lightweight ESN model.
- Improved model maintainability through code modularization.
- Gained real-world insight into how ML models interact with financial data.

## Credits

This project was adapted from the original implementation by [michaelnny](https://github.com/michaelnny/ReservoirComputing/blob/main/RC_StockPriceSPY.py).  
All modifications and restructuring were done as part of an internship to explore and enhance modular machine learning pipelines.
